1- Uppercase "F" used in "for"; never ending loop.

2- Missing "break" statement before "case 1", without it the control flow will fallthrough the next case.

3- The counter variable "x" should be decremented by 2 instead of incremented.

4- This code will print until 98, because of the condition " < 100"; 
"while" should not be written with a capital "W".
