1) Uppercase "F" used in "for"; commas used in the "for" header instead of semicolons; never ending loop.

2) Missing "break" statement before "case 1", without it the control flow will fallthrough the next case.

3) Infinite loop, the counter variable "x" should be decremented by 2 instead of incremented.

4) This code will print until 98, because of the condition " < 100"; 
"while" should not be written with a capital "W".
