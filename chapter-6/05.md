1) It means that numbers in a determined range have an equal chance to be selected without ways to predict the result.

2) Using the adequate manipulations, it allows to select numbers at "random" in a choosen range.

3) To enable the program to change the result of random everytime it runs. Using rand() without srand() outputs the same result everytime, this behavior is desired when debugging or testing.

4) To reach the range of desired numbers.

5) Computerized real-world simulation can predict the outcome of a proccess without having to take it to the real-world.
